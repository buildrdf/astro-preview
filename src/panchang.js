/* ===================================================================
   PANCHANG AND DAILY GOCHARA
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   The five limbs of the Vedic day, plus the two classical techniques
   that make a daily reading personal rather than sun-sign generic:

     Tara Bala  - the relationship between today's Moon nakshatra and
                  the nakshatra the Moon occupied at your birth
     Gochara    - where each of the nine grahas is transiting relative
                  to your Moon and your lagna

   Everything here is arithmetic on longitudes the ephemeris produced.
   Nothing is generated, and no interpretation is invented: the gochara
   tables are the standard Parashari ones. Schools differ, most visibly
   over Rahu and Ketu; where they do, that is stated in the app rather
   than hidden.
